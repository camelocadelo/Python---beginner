The catenary is the form that a chain (or a rope without stiffness) assumes,
when it is fixed at two points.

Runge-Kutta methods are a well-known family of numerical methods that
are used for solving differential equations.

The same methods implemented in C++ and Python are measured using /import timeit/ to find the difference.
